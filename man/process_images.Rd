\description{
Markdown specification is not always clear about what goes in the text part
of an image. Pandoc specifies a markdown image as
\figure{img.png}{alt="alt text"}
Since commonmark does not recognize the alt-text, we need to find it
ourselves.
}
\details{
Moreover, it's possible to include HTML images, so we need to parse the HTML
to expose the alt text.
