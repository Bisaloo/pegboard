The former Jekyll syntax used [kramdown-flavoured
markdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html), which evolved separately
from [commonmark](https://spec.commonmark.org/), the syntax that {pegboard} 
knows and that Pandoc-flavoured markdown extends. One of the key differences 
with the kramdown syntax is that it used something known as [Inline Attribute 
Lists (IAL)](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#inline-attribute-lists) to
help define classes for markdown elements. These elements were formated as
`{: <attributes>}` where `<attributes>` is replaced by class definitions and
key/value pairs. They always appear _after_ the relevant block which lead to
code blocks that looked like this:

````markdown
~~~
ls -larth /path/to/dir
~~~
{: .language-bash}
````

Moreover, to achieve the special callout blocks, we used blockquotes that were
given special classes (which is an accessbility no-no because those blocks were
not semantic HTML) and the nesting of these block quotes looked like this:


````markdown
> ## Challenge
> 
> How do you list all files in a directory in reverse order by the time it was 
> last updated?
> 
> > ## Solution
> > 
> > ~~~
> > ls -larth /path/to/dir
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-bash}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
````

One of the biggest challenges with this for authors was that, unless you used an
editor like vim or emacs, this was difficult to write with all the prefixed 
blockquote characters and keeping track of which IALs belonged to which block.
