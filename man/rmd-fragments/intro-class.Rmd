The {pegboard} package facilitates the analysis and manipulation of Markdown and
R Markdown files by translating them to XML and back again. This extends the
{tinkr} package (see `vignette("tinkr", package = "tinkr")`) by providing
additional methods that are specific for Carpentries-style lessons. There are
two `R6` classes defined in {pegboard}:

 - `pegboard::Episode` objects that contain the XML data, YAML metadata and
   extra fields that define the child and parent files for a particular
   episode. These inherit from the `tinkr::yarn` R6 class. 
- `pegboard::Lesson` objects that contain lists of `Episode` objects
  categorised as "episodes", "extra", or "children".
