Description: The Carpentries (<https://carpentries.org>) curricula is made of of
    lessons that are hosted as websites. Each lesson represents between a half
    day to two days of instruction and contains several episodes, which are
    written as 'kramdown'-flavored 'markdown' documents and converted to HTML
    using the 'Jekyll' static website generator. This package builds on top of
    the 'tinkr' package; reads in these markdown documents to 'XML' and
    stores them in R6 classes for convenient exploration and manipulation of
    sections within episodes.
