   desc: >
     Styles-era Carpentries lessons used kramdown syntax, which has a very 
     different set of features (such as postfix tags and liquid templating)
     that require extra post-processing. These functions processed this syntax
     and offerd ways of translating it to the more common pandoc syntax. (Note,
     this is a non-exhaustive list).

   - fix_links
   - fix_liquid_relative_link
   - get_blocks
   - get_code
   - liquid_to_commonmark
